# What is this about?
This is a web-page which facilitates accentuation of Ghañanta words in Skt. using Pā́ṇini’s rules. Originally written in JavaScript, later included within a web-page. 
This can be seen as a small step in building a much larger accentuation engine based on Vedic as well Classical rules with higher features. 

# Rules pertaining to accention of Ghañanta-s
* "ñnityādír nítyam" - AA 6.1.197
* "karṣā́tvato ghañontódā́ttaḥ" - AA 6.1.159
* "vŕ̥ṣādīnāṁ ca" - AA 6.1.203
* "tyā́garā́gahā́sakúhaśváṭhakráthānām" - AA 6.1.216
* "thā́thaghañktā́jabítrakā́ṇām"- AA 6.2.144

For comopunds, please use a hyphen between the members of the compound.

A much larger accentuation project is underway, attempting to account for the entire Sanskrit accentuation regime.
